# 2018-Game-Jam-USEK-Demo
A demo made for the game jam of USEK in 2018

i've been using this model which is free.

https://free3d.com/3d-model/wraith-raider-starship-22193.html

but it can't be uploaded or distributed without concent

So

1.- Uncompress SDK/SDK.zip into the SDK folder and have fun

2.- in the Release and Debug folder create Models and Models/Maps folders

3.- put the .mtl and .obj files into the Models folder

4.- put the textures in Maps folder

5.- in SpaceshipDemo.cpp, line 420 is the path to obj file. change it if needed

6.- Open SpaceshipDemo.sln, set the target as x86, compile and run

Regards
